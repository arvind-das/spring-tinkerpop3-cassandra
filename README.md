# spring-tinkerpop3-cassandra
Started this project for spring framework integration with tinkerpop3 support while maintaining transaction.

`Currently the outcome may not be good code or following standards, trying to maintain it from the beginning`.

Eventually all the test cases will be integrated, initial thought process is to get it integrated with cassandra database.
